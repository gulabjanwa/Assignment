     <!-- Q.50 What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects? -->
     <p>This is a repeat of Q.47. The answer remains that declaring methods directly in JavaScript
        objects results in each instance having its own copy of the method, which is memory-inefficient
         compared to shared methods using prototypes.</p>
