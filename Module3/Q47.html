     <!-- Q.47 What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects? -->
     <p>When methods are declared directly in JavaScript objects, each instance of the object will 
        have its own copy of the method, leading to higher memory consumption. Using prototypes, 
        especially in constructor functions, allows methods to be shared across instances.</p>
