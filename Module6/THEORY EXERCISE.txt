• Question 1: What is React Router? How does it handle routing in single-page applications?
ANS:
React Router is a standard library used to handle client-side routing in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

In SPAs, all pages are loaded dynamically without refreshing the browser, and routing is handled on the client side using JavaScript.

✅ How it works:
React Router maps URL paths to specific components.

When the URL changes, React Router updates the view by rendering the corresponding component — without reloading the entire page.

• Question 2: Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch
components in React Router.
ANS:
| Component         | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BrowserRouter** | The top-level component that enables routing using the HTML5 history API.                             |
| **Route**         | Declares a route and specifies which component to render based on the path.                           |
| **Link**          | Replaces anchor (`<a>`) tags and prevents page reloads. Navigates internally.                         |
| **Switch**        | (In React Router v5) Renders the **first** child `<Route>` that matches. In v6, replaced by `Routes`. |
